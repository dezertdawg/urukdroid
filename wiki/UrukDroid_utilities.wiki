#summary Some UrukDroid installed utilities.

= Introduction =

There are plenty of utilities installed with UrukDroid. Most of them are OS level binary tools and scripts, so they can be used over SSH and/or terminal. They can be also used by some rare Android programs. Here you can find list of most common GNU tools available on Uruk and more detailed information about native Uruk scripts and tools.

== IOBench.sh ==

== copy_from_sd_to_internal.sh ==

This is simple script that I use to copy (kind of backup for me) my UrukDroid installation from SDcard to Internal storage. This way whenever I would broke something on me development platform (SDcard) I could easily boot to internal (just remove SDcard and reboot) and fix problem.

It's recommended to run this script on "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen screen]" - since it's quite CPU consuming operation and sometimes it brakes WiFi connection (of course if you run it over ssh).

This script can be also used to migrate from external Uruk Droid installation to internal one.

Below is an example of use:
