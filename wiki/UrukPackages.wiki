= Details =

For doing all type of already installed system I've prepared packaging system. It's easy and flexible way of modifying Uruk.

== Type of packages ==

Like you already know, we have three types of UrukDroid packages

=== Update ===

This is most common type of packages, it brings all those small changes and fixes to system. This packages usually works in "overwrite" mode - so nothing is erased.
Proper update can made on system level (so device restart is not required) and on boot time level (during boot up process you will see message about update being applied)

=== Upgrade ===

This type is used mostly during major system upgrades. All work is done during bootup process and inflicts erasing most of *rootfs* data. So probably all you service configurations will be overwritten.

=== Kernel ===



== Installation ==

To install package you need to simply copy/move it to */data/UrukUpdate* folder.
