== How to gather data from UrukDroid for reports purpose ? ==

The best way is to use [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell SSH]. To do this, please start "[UrukService_sshd sshd service] on UrukDroid by using [UrukConfig] application or by editing /etc/uruk.conf/sshd file.
First start can take up to one minute - since sshd has to generate unique encryption keys.
If you use Windows download [http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.exe putty.exe] (ssh client) and run it. Write your Archos IP (it has to be visible in local WiFi network) and connect.
Use
{{{
Login: root
Password: UrukDroid
}}}
Now you can write Linux commands and cut/paste results for help/debug purpose.


== What is current directory/disk layout? ==
{{{
/ -> rootfs partition (default 512M) - for root filesystem
/data -> datafs partition (default 1GB) - for installed apps
/mnt/storage -> internal storage partition - for data used by installed apps
/mnt/storage/sdcard -> SDCard third partition - anything you want, nothing by default
}}}

And there is something called symbolic links (symlinks) - witch are kind of Win shortcuts used on UN*X extensively.
{{{
/sdcard -> /mnt/storage
/storage -> /mnt/storage
/mnt/sdcard -> /mnt/storage
}}}
So you can enter /sdcard - and you are be using files from /mnt/storage. You can also create symlinks by yourself
{{{
su
ln -s /source destinations
}}}
