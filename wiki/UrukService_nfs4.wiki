#summary UrukDroid NFS4 service.

= Introduction =

NFS is another network file sharing protocol (like [UrukService_smb smb], [UrukService_cifs cifs]), but this one is most efficient and robust. It's usable probably only for Linux/UN*X users (they can easily create shares) - but there are some Windows implementation of NFS servers.
NFS4 is a most recent NFS implementation that is easier to maintain on firewall, and requires less daemons to work on both client and server side.

UrukDroid implementation of NFS4 has also one more feature - it can use EXT4 filesystem as a local cache. This may help streaming video on WiFi network.

= How to use NFS4 service =

Most simple configuration requires you to have NFS4 server visible in local network. Then you need to setup share option in configuration file "/etc/uruk.conf/nfs4"
{{{
nfs4_source="10.8.10.1:/data/"
}}}
and of course start NFS4 service.

In configuration above I use [UrukService_openvpn OpenVPN] server so it works from (almost) every place I have internet.

= Configuration file =

*Location: /etc/uruk.conf/compcache*

*Configuration options:*
 * nfs4_disable_smbc - if enabled, NFS4 service will disable smb fuse client before mounting share. Since default place to mount nfs4 on Archos is in place of SMB share - it's wise to disable it. _Default: 1_ (disable smb client)
 * nfs4_disable_ndmp - if enabled, NFS4 service will disable NDMP client before mounting share. This is just for memory consumption limitation. _Default: 1_ (disable ndmp client)
 * nfs4_source - NFS4 share in form of IP/path value. For example "192.168.1.200:/export". _Default: none_
 * nfs4_mpoint - this is local NFS4 mount point. Place where all mounted files will be visible. By default it points to place where smb files are mounted "/mnt/storage/network/smb/" - with this "trick" MediaPlayer will be able to play all files from NFS4 share. Of course it can by any location, like usual Linux place in "/mnt" directory. _Default: "/mnt/storage/network/smb/"_
 * nfs4_cache_enable - should NFS4 service use local cache for remote files. It may greatly increase NFS4 file streaming "feel" - but requires some additional work (see below). _Default: 0_
