#summary UrukDroid NFS4 service.

= Introduction =

NFS is another network file sharing protocol (like [UrukService_smb smb], [UrukService_cifs cifs]), but this one is most efficient and robust. It's usable probably only for Linux/UN*X users (they can easily create shares) - but there are some Windows implementation of NFS servers.
NFS4 is a most recent NFS implementation that is easier to maintain on firewall, and requires less daemons to work on both client and server side.

UrukDroid implementation of NFS4 has also one more feature - it can use EXT4 filesystem as a local cache. This may help streaming video on WiFi network.
