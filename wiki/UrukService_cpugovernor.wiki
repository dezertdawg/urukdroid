#summary UrukDroid CPU governor service.

= Introduction =

Since our Android/Linux is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_multitasking multitasking] capable, CPU needs to share it's cycles to more then one running task. This is a job for "CPU governor".

Linux has few default governors like performace, ondemand, powersafe. With UrukDroid there is one more called interactive - this CPU governor was made by people from CyanogenMOD.

To set desired governor you should use this service (this can be done by many more applications from market - but not with all available options).

= Special options =

With cpugovernor service you can see some low level CPU statistics. It's quite useful for performance/battery draining tuning - and debugging of course.
{{{
[root@urukdroid uruk.d]# ./cpugovernor stats
Uruk-CPUGovernor statistics:
        Current governor: interactive
        Overclock module: Disabled
        CPU Max: 1000000
        CPU Min: 300000
        Available frequencies: 1000000 800000 600000 300000
CPU statistics (tick spend in every frequency range):
        1000 MHz had    29720 ticks     (13.95%)
        800 MHz had     1984 ticks      (0.93%)
        600 MHz had     61024 ticks     (28.65%)
        300 MHz had     120333 ticks    (56.49%)
}}}
You can see here current CPU governor, min/max CPU frequencies (used by governor - this are not hardware min/max), available CPU frequencies and table with CPU frequency and number of ticks CPU spend with this clock value.
In this case CPU mostly works on 300Mhz (56.49%), 600Mhz (28.65%), 800Mhz (0.93%) and 1Ghz (13.95%).

= Overclocking =

Since UrukDroid 1.6 (RC3 exactly) there is build in overclocking kernel module ([http://code.google.com/p/milestone-overclock/ Milestone overclock]). Basic settings are available through CPUGovernor service.

In configuration file, you can enable overclocking module and set max. CPU frequency.

== How to enable overclocking? ==

First, you should do rootfs backup (from Uruk RescueMenu) - in case if your device became unbootable, you can restore old config.

Then enable in CPUGovernor config file overclocking:
{{{
# Overclock
# 0 = disabled, 1 = enabled
enable_overclock=1
}}}
This will NOT overclock your CPU, it will just enable overclocking (it will load overclock.ko kernel module) - this step is quite safe, so you can enable it in configuration file.

Reboot your device and check if overclocking is running
{{{
[root@urukdroid root]# /etc/uruk.d/cpugovernor stats
Uruk-CPUGovernor statistics:
        Current governor: interactive
        Overclock module: Enabled
}}}

If its enabled - your are good to go to next step. Now you should check manually (without putting it to configuration file) what values are good for you. You need to specify MAX CPU frequency and voltage.

{{{
echo 66 > /proc/overclock/max_vsel
echo 1100000 > /proc/overclock/max_rate
}}}

First value is voltage, second on is CPU frequency in hz. If you find some stable values, you can set them up in configuration file:
{{{
# Overclock settings
max_vsel=68
max_rate=1100000
}}}

Higher vsel = higher voltage.

To calculate voltage: *max_vsel*12,5 + 600 = real mV*

Default value for 1Ghz is 60 (1,35V).

= Configuration file =

*Location:* /etc/uruk.conf/cpugovernor

*Configuration options:*
 * cpu_governor - name of CPU governor (can be any one from Linux available). _Default: interactive_
 * cpu_governor_default - name of CPU governor used when this service is disabled/stopped. _Default: ondemand_
 * cpu_freq_max/cpu_freq_min - if you want to narrow down range of frequencies that CPU governor will use - set this option. You can choose only values from "Available frequencies" (see ./cpugovernor stats). _Default: ""_ (not set)
