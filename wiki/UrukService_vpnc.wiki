#summary UrukDroid Cisco VPN service.

= Introduction =

CISCO developed it's own standard for VPN. Because of it, we have to use separate VPN tool. Luckily there is a open source "[http://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~massar/vpnc/ vpnc]".

vpnc is supposed to work with:

 * Cisco VPN concentrator 3000 Series
 * Cisco IOS routers
 * Cisco PIX / ASA Zecurity Appliances
 * Juniper/Netscreen 

 * Supported Authentications: Hybrid, Pre-Shared-Key + XAUTH, Pre-Shared-Key
 * Supported IKE DH-Groups: dh1 dh2 dh5
 * Supported Hash Algo (IKE/IPSEC): md5 sha1
 * Supported Encryptions (IKE/IPSEC): (null) (1des) 3des aes128 aes192 aes256
